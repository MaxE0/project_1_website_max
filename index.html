<p>The PC is a good gaming machine but they can be expensive. If you want a
  console the Ps4 or Xbox is a good choice. And there are many other
  consoles that you can choose from. Also you play games on your phone. Gaming is everywhere.</p>
  <p>To play games you don't need the best computer but if you want to play the best games on ultra settings and have a good frame
    rate then you need to spend a good amount of money. Just don't play for to long. And then
    go outside and hang out with your friends. And don't be that kid
    that rages when he loses in a game and screams into his mic. Just
    play your games for fun.</p>
