    <h1>Console Gaming</h1>
    <p>Do you want something less expensive that can play a lot of games?
      The Playstion 4 or Xbox one might be for you then. The Ps4 costs about 300-400
      dollars and so does the Xbox one. On consles you can play a lot of games
      at 60 frames per second and a resolution of 1080p. The new Xbox One S and Playstation
      pro can play at a resolution of 4k I think.Also the ps4 only has 500GB on its base model.You can use that pretty fast.</p>
<h1>Limitations for Consoles</h1>
      <p>Consoles do come with limitations like you have to pay
        for an online subscription. For a month you have to play 10 dollars, for
        three months you have to pay 25 dollars and for a year you have to pay
        60 dollars. Things can get expensive over time. Playstation and
        Xbox have exclusive games for only their system.There are also more consoles
        for you to choose from.
