    <h4><p>PC gaming has its ups and downs. The PC is a leading
       gaming machine right now because there are vast choices of games that you can choose from.
        There are many places where you can get PC games. Like Steam and g2a. There are many
        types of PC games,from MMOs to first person shooter games. If you pay the right price you
        can get a great gaming machine that can play every title and get high frame rates.</p>
        <p>When you are picking out your PC you should decide if you want it for gaming, for just web browsing and
          everyday tasks, or both. You can build your own own PC or just buy a prebuild one. You can buy a
          prebuilt PC from IBUYPOWER or any of the other prebuilt PC sources. If you want to play thousands
          or millions of games and can play the price a PC is for you. But if you want to play games
          for a cheaper price then a console is for you.</p>
