    <h1>Console Gaming</h1>
    <p>Do you want something less expensive that can play a lot of games?
      The Playstion 4 or Xbox one might be for you then. The Ps4 costs about 300-400
      dollars and so does the Xbox one. On consles you can play a lot of games
      at 60 frames per second and a resolution of 1080p. The new Xbox one s and playstation
      pro can play at a resolution of 4k I think.</p>
      <p>Consoles do come with limitations like you have to pay
        for an online subscription. For a month you have to play 10 dollars, for
        three months you have to pay 25 dollars and for a year you have to pay
        60 dollars. Things can get expensive over time. Playstation and
        Xbox have exclusive games for only their system.
